Created  a  full-stack  application  that  extracts  and  summarizes  text  from  images  using  Google  Gemini  AI. 
Enabled  image  upload  functionality,  designed  a  responsive  UI  with  React  and  Tailwind  CSS,  and  built  a 
Flask-based  backend  to  handle  image  processing  through  RESTful  API  integration.  Implemented  loading 
states and error handling to ensure smooth and user-friendly interaction during image processing.
